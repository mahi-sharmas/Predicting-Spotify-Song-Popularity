ðŸŽ¶ Predicting Spotify Song Popularity

This project aims to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify using machine learning techniques. By analyzing audio features provided by the Spotify API/dataset, we build predictive models that estimate how popular a track might become.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Objective: Predict the popularity score (0â€“100) of songs.

Dataset: Spotify audio features dataset (tempo, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, valence, duration, etc.).


ðŸš€ Results

Insights into which features most strongly affect popularity (e.g., danceability, energy).

Machine learning models that achieve strong predictive performance on test data.

Visualizations showing relationships between song features and popularity.
